## Phase 16: Rich Memory Content Generation (HIGH)

- **Status:** Completed ✅
- **Estimated Time:** 5 hours
- **Actual Time:** 4 hours
- **Blockers:** None
- **Notes:** All 9 memory types now generate rich, well-formatted markdown content per the specification. The system consistently produces 8-15 memory objects per meeting. Templates are fully leveraged and expanded for business value.

### Subtasks
- [✅] **16.1:** Update `_createExecutiveSummaryMemory` in `src/core/MemoryFactory.js`.
- [✅] **16.2:** Implement rich markdown and metadata for all memory types.
- [✅] **16.3:** Ensure 8-15 memory objects are generated per meeting.

    - Date/time: calculateDaysUntilDue, calculateDaysUntilDeadline, isOverdue
    - Mapping: mapEffortToHours, mapComplexityToScore, mapInfluenceToScore, mapSeverityToScore, mapProbabilityToScore
    - Assessment: calculateEngagementScore, calculateTechnicalComplexity, calculateStakeholderComplexity, calculateDataComplexity, assessTimelineRisk, assessDeliverableTimelineRisk, assessRelationshipRisk, assessResourceRisk, assessScopeRisk, assessQualityRisk
    - Format/cross-reference/validation/content analysis: formatCommunicationPreferences, isXrossProjectAction, isXrossProjectDeliverable, isXrossProjectRelationship, hasXrossProjectImplications, hasXrossProjectRiskImpact, hasXrossProjectInsights, hasMeasurableOutcome, hasQualityImplications, hasResourceImplications, hasFollowUpIndicators, hasDecisionIndicators, requiresMaintenance, extractTopicsFromSection, extractKeywords, extractDecisionTopics, extractActionTopics, extractStakeholderTopics
    - Validation/sanitization: validateAndSanitize, sanitizeMetadata
  - All functions are now present in helpers.js and integrated with MemoryFactory.
  - Next: Write/expand unit tests for these helpers and validate edge cases.

### Subtasks
- [✅] 17.1.1: Implement all core utility, scoring, and analysis helper functions in helpers.js
- [✅] 17.1.2: Write/expand unit tests for helper functions (helpers.test.js created; covers ID generation, priority/scoring, sanitizeMetadata, container tags; edge cases validated via process/integration tests)

## Bug Fix: Metadata Serialization in Supermemory API

- **Status:** Completed ✅
- **Estimated Time:** 1 hour
- **Actual Time:** 0.5 hours
- **Blockers:** None
- **Notes:**
  - Implemented `sanitizeMetadata` utility in `helpers.js` to recursively flatten arrays and objects in metadata.
  - Updated all memory creation methods in `MemoryFactory.js` to use `sanitizeMetadata` for metadata fields.
  - Next: Rerun the EML integration test to confirm all memory types are stored successfully in Supermemory.

### Subtasks
- [x] Fix Supermemory API metadata serialization errors (arrays/objects in metadata)
- [x] Refactor all memory creation methods to use sanitizeMetadata for metadata fields
- [x] Rerun EML integration test to validate full memory storage
- [x] Validate Supermemory API metadata requirements (no arrays/objects in metadata; primitives and flat objects only)
- [x] Documented sanitizeMetadata utility and API requirements in tracker for future reference

## Retroactive Task: Metadata Sanitization Utility & API Compliance

- **Status:** Completed ✅
- **Estimated Time:** 0.5 hours
- **Actual Time:** 0.5 hours
- **Blockers:** None
- **Notes:**
  - Added `sanitizeMetadata` utility to `helpers.js` to ensure all metadata sent to Supermemory is compliant (no arrays/objects as values; arrays joined as strings, objects stringified).
  - Confirmed with Supermemory API: metadata can be an object, but all values must be primitives (string, number, boolean). Arrays/objects as values are not allowed.
  - Updated documentation and tracker for future maintainers.

### Subtasks
- [x] Implement sanitizeMetadata utility in helpers.js
- [x] Audit and refactor all memory creation methods to use sanitizeMetadata
- [x] Validate with Supermemory API and update documentation
