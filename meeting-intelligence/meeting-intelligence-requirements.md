# Temporal Meeting Intelligence System - Complete Requirements & Implementation Guide v3.0

The system provides deep temporal understanding of meeting discussions. It uses Weaviate for semantic search, Neo4j for temporal evolution tracking and a suite of LLM-based extractors and processors.

See `src/temporal_extractor.py`, `src/storage_manager.py`, `src/temporal_query_processor.py` and `src/api.py` for the main implementation.
