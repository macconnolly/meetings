# Meeting Intelligence System

This project implements a Python-based Meeting Intelligence System. It processes meeting emails, extracts structured "memory" objects and stores them in vector and graph databases. The system is designed to run on Python **3.11+** and uses type hints throughout the codebase.

The project is currently in its initialization phase. Future phases will add advanced extraction, storage and query capabilities based on the `meeting-intelligence-requirements.md` specifications.
