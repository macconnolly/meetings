# Temporal Meeting Intelligence System

This project implements a prototype of the Temporal Meeting Intelligence System. It uses Weaviate for semantic search, Neo4j for temporal relationship tracking and FastAPI for an API layer.

Run the stack using `docker-compose up` and then send transcripts to the `/meetings/ingest` endpoint. Queries can be made to `/query`.
