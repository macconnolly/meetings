# Temporal Meeting Intelligence System

This project implements a Python-based **Temporal Meeting Intelligence System**. It processes meeting emails, extracts structured "memory" objects and stores them in both vector and graph databases. The codebase targets Python **3.11+** and uses type hints throughout.

The project is currently in its initialization phase. Future phases will add advanced extraction, storage and query capabilities based on the `temporal-meeting-intelligence-requirements.md` specifications.
