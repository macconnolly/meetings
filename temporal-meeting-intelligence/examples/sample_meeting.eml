BRV Readiness Coordination and Testing Update

June 2025 BRV Readiness & =
Testing Coordination Meeting

---

## Main Topics Discussed

### 1. Hypercare and Workshop Slide Preparations
- Mac and Jack have closed=
 the loop on previously discussed Hypercare items.
- Prashant is leading =
the creation of slides for the BRV Readiness Workshop.
- Meeting scheduled this afternoon (June 17th, 2025) with Paul and Jeff to =
review slide content and finalize inputs.
- Jack is integrating Hypercare =
slides from Priya and Elias, along with IT function slides for the final =
deck.

### 2. Purpose and Context of the Call
- Main focus: How functional =
groups will report their perception and status of system readiness, =
specifically from a User Acceptance Testing (UAT) perspective.
- Discussion centers on validating which functions are testing which =
systems and coordination of test completion for the August 1st, 2025 =
readiness date.

### 3. BRV Readiness Trackers and Heatmaps
- Two key trackers in use: one for =E2=80=9CDay 1=E2=80=9D applications and=
 another for the August 1st =E2=80=9CBRV Core=E2=80=9D (~22 systems) and =
adjacent systems.
- These trackers are heat maps capturing statuses (e.g., =
SIT readiness, UAT start/end dates, assigned resources, environment, data =
availability, go-live dates).
- Functional alignment calls held with =
Finance, ISC (Integrated Supply Chain), HR, and others to identify core and=
 adjacent systems.
    - BRV core currently at 14 systems; additional =
adjacent systems identified due to dependencies for August 1st.

### 4. Testing Data Collection and Validation
- Each function/workstream is=
 responsible for validating and updating their data in the tracker.
- Inputs updated manually after being sent to workstream leads and service =
owners (e.g., Harry Tong for Finance).
- Request from Sukai earlier in the =
day: develop a table listing actual test scripts and tracking detailed =
results (number, ownership, outcome).
- ERP team and others are developing =
standardized trackers/templates for their test cases, by function and =
workstream.

### 5. Cross-Functional Testing & Coordination
- Discussion on how cross-functional testing is managed, especially for ERP=
 and ISC.
- Honeywell project manager appointed; an MOS (Management =
Operating System) structure is being established for coordination.
- Daily syncs at the UAT coordinator and test lead levels.
- Regular functional alignment calls scheduled (Finance, HR, ISC) feeding =
into broader weekly reporting cycles:
    - Wednesday: All-hands offset =
call
    - Thursday: Debrief
    - Friday: Status consolidation

### 6. Systems Dashboard & Data Integration with Capital Edge
- Proposal to extract the tracker weekly and update the functions' =
dashboards in Capital Edge, ensuring accurate system counts per function =
for the upcoming workshop.
- Immediate need: Extract of updated tracker by =
end of day or next day (June 18th) to update dashboards, especially =
highlighting the correct number of systems each function is testing.
- Long-term plan: Move data consolidation and reporting into Smartsheet, =
synced regularly with Capital Edge for steady-state reporting.
- Brian is working on integrating the data model and dashboard in Capital =
Edge.
- For the upcoming workshop, it=E2=80=99s acceptable if the data =
isn't immediately in Capital Edge, so long as the correct numbers populate =
the dashboards.
- Coordination between Mac, Brian, and others scheduled =
pre-OPSEP call to finalize reporting mechanics.

---

## Action Items & Next Steps

1. **Finalize Slides**: Prashant to finish =
workshop slide deck with Paul and Jeff today.
2. **Tracker Updates**: =
Workstream leads update the BRV readiness tracker with current data by end =
of June 17th, 2025.
3. **Extract for Dashboard**: Mac/team to provide a cut=
 of the tracker (either EOD June 17th or June 18th) for dashboard updates.
4. **Coordinate with Brian**: Meeting to be set pre-OPSEP call to ensure =
Capital Edge dashboards update as required for next week=E2=80=99s workshop=
.
5. **Functional Leads**: Continue manually validating and updating =
statuses in tracker, especially for UAT completion, system counts, and =
cross-functional dependencies.
6. **Notes on Reporting**: Capital Edge will=
 note that system tracker data is being updated and will reflect in =
dashboards soon.
7. **Future-State Process**: Establish steady-state =
Smartsheet sync for ongoing, automated dashboarding and reporting.

---

## Key Dates & Figures

- June 17th, 2025: Call held, tracker updates =
expected by EOD, slide review with Paul & Jeff.
- August 1st, 2025: Target =
readiness date for BRV Core and adjacent systems.
- ~14 systems currently =
at BRV core; 22+ including adjacent systems to be tracked.
- Next week's (week of June 23rd, 2025) workshop is key milestone for =
dashboard/reporting readiness.

---

## Additional Notes

- The current process is manual but moving toward automation/integration.
- Coordination across IT, Finance, ISC, and HR continues to ensure all =
dependencies are documented and tracked.
- The main immediate concern is =
having accurate system counts reflected per function for reporting and =
workshop discussions.
- Dedicated structure (MOS, daily/weekly calls) in =
place to synchronize functional readiness and interdependent testing =
streams.

Share screen while we chat today.

0:03
Sure, sure.

0:10
So we can all see it. Mac, I think you and. You and Jack =
probably closed loop on the Hypercare items from our other chat, so sorry =
for bothering y' all with that earlier.

0:22
No, no worries. I think that =
we do need Prashant. He was running point on this, at least on the template=
 creation for the slides for the readiness workshop. And they have a =
meeting this afternoon with Paul and Jeff to review the content that we =
have so far. And I think that he's been chasing some of the inputs for =
those, so I recognize that they need. We're looking to get those finalized.=
 We just have to have. I think that they're in Morris plans today. =
Finalizing those with Paul.

1:01
Yeah, sounds good.

1:03
Sorry, they're finalizing, like, slides or.

1:11
Yeah, so I. I think that =
we were talking about the same thing. They were finalizing the BRV =
Readiness Workshop slides.

1:20
The workshop slides. Okay, got it.

1:22
I think that's what Jack was chasing us for, right?

1:25
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. When you said hypercare, I was a little confused. =
Okay.

1:31
Yeah. So, Priya, I think Jack was gonna pull in the Hypercare =
slides that you and Elias had created and then also the. Of course, the IT =
function slides.

1:40
So two kind of two things there.

1:42
That might be where the confusion came from.

1:49
Okay, so on this topic, =
Mac, I think we. So let me see.

2:02
Rakesh is joining, but. Yeah, so I =
guess, like, what's the context for this call?

2:07
Yeah, look, fundamentally we're just trying to figure out, like, how =
functions are going to report out on, like, their percept. Their, like, =
perception on system readiness.

2:18
Right?

2:18
So, like, from a UAT =
perspective, like, how are functions going to come in and say, like, UAT is=
 complete, or, like, we have our scenarios, we have our test scripts or =
what have you. I mean, not necessarily how. Like, we know how.

2:32
Right. We.

2:33
We intend for them to do it in this tool, but I think =
we've been talking a lot about, like, trying to figure out which functions =
are testing what systems, and that's what I think Annie and I are, like, =
looking to get an update on.

2:47
Yeah, absolutely. Let me see if Rakesh =
can join, because I can talk you through it, but I don't want to misspeak, =
but. And so there's been a lot that's gone on in the last two days, but we =
have two trackers that are effectively heat maps for BRV readiness, both =
for the day one chunk of apps and then also for the. So the. The day one =
chunk of apps and then the august first chunk of, like, the True BRV core =
group, like the 22 or so, and then all of the apps that are adjacent to =
those. So we've held functional alignment calls with Finance, isc, HR and =
said, what are the key systems that you're testing that are in the core BRV=
 group and then what are the ones that are ancillary to those? So we're =
calling those like they're not brv, but they're BR V adjacent. So it might =
not be changing, but it is part of the test or the scope of the scenario =
that they need to execute for the August 1st readiness date. And so we have=
 those two trackers and those are effectively heat maps. And I could share =
my screen, I can walk you through one of them. We've been using these to =
prepare heat maps for Sukai. Let me share this one. So this is the BRV =
validation tracker.

4:27
Yeah, and.

4:32
And we're tracking everything =
from SIT readiness, SIT resourcing, uat, start, end, the names of people, =
the number of test groups defined, do they have the. Which environment is =
it going to be running, when is the system going to be ready to test, when =
is the data access for their test going to be available, completion status,=
 and then ultimately like a go live date. And so we've aligned all of these=
 dates with the functional leads so far during those calls. We just had one=
 of the asks from Sukai earlier today was to then develop a table with the =
actual test data. So we are going to have to start double clicking into all=
 of these. So we met with the ERP team and then also Srinivas to put =
together trackers for the testing that they're actually going to be doing. =
So the test scripts that they're going to be running associated with each =
scenario, how many have been built, defined and tested so that they have a =
standardized template and way of reporting on the underlying data for this.=
 Right, so testing completion status. She wants to know how many test =
scripts are there for what scenario, what is being tested, and then what =
are the outcomes of that. And so the ERP team as well as Srinivas for ISC =
and Finance are putting together those central or standardized trackers =
where they can measure. Here's the work stream, here's the number of test =
cases, and then here's a link to the all of the scripts for Finance, all of=
 the scripts for banking, for all of their work stream, their sub work =
streams, they're tracking all of the scripts for them individually. So yeah=
, go ahead.

6:18
Sorry.

6:20
But just let's take a step back. Right, so =
the ERP is that Who. So in this tracker is there just like one line item =
for the erp?

6:33
In this tracker there is just one line item for the erp.=
 Yeah.

6:39
So who is responsible for, like this, like, you know, UAT =
schedule aligned, like the, like, red and yellows on this page?

6:51
I guess it will be for the UAT schedule aligned. It's their UAT functional =
lead.

6:59
Okay, so we have names and boxes for the UAT function, function=
 or. Okay, so I see. So for erp, for example, you have many functional =
leads.

7:12
Yes, that right, yeah. One person for credit, one person for =
disputes.

7:18
Okay, so then like, who again, like, how are you getting =
pending for UAT test resource, for example?

7:27
We haven't validated. I =
mean, these are all like, man, these are all input manually.

7:37
Okay.

7:37
And like, so how are you going to. How are we going to like, validate =
it?

7:45
I guess so it's been sent around to the workstream lead. So Harry=
 Tong from Finance is in here right now validating. So we've essentially =
compiled all of the information that we have from the functional alignment =
calls and put out a call to action for the workstream leads and the service=
 owners. So Honeywell workstream lead, Honeywell IT lead, the service owner=
. We put out a call to these folks to come in and for all of your rows. =
Basically, anything that's blank or anything that is yellow needs to be =
validated.

8:18
Okay.

8:18
And so that's what Harry's in there doing =
right now. The other. Yeah, go ahead.

8:23
Sorry.

8:27
This is great.

8:27
Like, it's great that this tracker exists. I. I just want to, like, =
kind of make sure I understand how. How it works. So this list that we're =
looking at right now, it's more than 22, right?

8:40
Correct. Because some of them are BRV adjacent. So they're.

8:46
Okay.

8:46
The core BRV ones is fewer than 22. Right now we're at 14. And then =
BRV adjacent. These came up in. In the need to test in order to get to =
August 1st readiness.

9:05
Yeah.

9:07
In conjunction with these. So ISC. =
Yeah, go ahead.

9:14
So. So they. They will all need to be complete for a =
one.

9:18
Yes.

9:19
From a testing perspective.

9:20
Yeah.

9:21
Okay. Okay. All right.

9:23
This is helpful.

9:28
Okay. Okay.

9:31
And okay, so sorry I cut you off as you were starting to talk about the ERP=
 specifically and like, how those test cases are managed.

9:42
Yeah, those test cases are managed because ERP is largely automated. I =
think that the ERP team will output the. Into that template that we were =
just working with them on. And the next step for us is the ask for tomorrow=
 is for Sukai by function and then by workstream. What is the test =
mechanism and what is the underlying test data and what is the summary? So =
a roll up view of for each of the functions, what are we testing, how are =
we testing it and then what specifically detailed tests are going into it.

10:24
Okay.

10:32
And so we have that. So this tracker, we have the same =
version of this for. This is the August 1st readiness. We have the same, =
same thing for day one.

10:44
Yeah, so I don't want to move off.

10:49
No, go ahead. I mean, what else, what else is on your mind?

10:54
Okay, so is the ERP the only one that has like cross functional testing or =
the. So like outside of the erp, is it largely like single function?

11:06
I wouldn't say so. I would say ERP finance is largely cross functional. =
There's a few things in ISC that are cross functional.

11:19
Okay, but I guess like, so like those cross functional ones, like are, are =
you managing who like has like, has there been like one point of contact =
identified to kind of drive UAT and like put status and coordinate with =
testers and all of that?

11:40
Yeah, yeah. So the, so we're setting up, we=
, they, they gave us a Honeywell project manager and we're meeting with her=
 today. We set up an MOS structure to accomplish just that, to align all of=
 these folks cross functionally. Right now we've had those one off =
alignment sessions. Like we had UAT IT and Finance all together and UAT ISC=
 and IT all together. And so we have identified what are the =
interdependencies across these and then what are the specific MOS calls =
that need to be set up. They need to come from a Honeywell email address. =
So what I've been doing today is putting together like the, the specifics =
of that. Here's who needs to be on each invite and so on and so forth. So =
yes, that coordination, I mean that's really our job, right as in brv, is =
to act as that sort of connective tissue to ensure that that alignment =
happens with the testing schedules, with the tests that have =
interdependencies. And we've documented most of those. Like there's, =
there's like a finance app that has to wait for an output from the ERP =
testing to use as their input file for their test. And so we've documented =
those interdependencies and we're going to look to start those, to let =
those folks manage them in those MLS calls.

13:08
Okay. Okay, this is a =
question.

13:16
Cross functional MOS call with that program manager and =
like these like testing leads.

13:25
Yeah, here Let me show you the. I'm =
gonna. Let me share the. This is the. Here are the. The details of that.

13:46
Okay.

13:51
It's largely at the UAT coordinator. And then the test =
leads level, we feed status into the All IT connect. Use that for calls to =
action. There's a daily sync across with all of those UAT coordinators.

14:07
Okay.

14:07
And then specifically from the functions, there's =
various functional alignment calls on Tuesdays that will be set up like =
Finance, hr, ise, the big ones. And we'll feed that into. I think the big =
goal is the Wednesday offset. All hands call. Thursday's the debrief. =
Friday is like the individual work status consolidation.

14:34
Okay. Okay. That's awesome.

14:35
And that would start next. Probably not =
next week, but the weekend or next week. You'd probably have to do it at =
the BRB workshop.

14:44
Yeah.

14:45
Like in the IT section.

14:46
Which is fine.

14:47
Yep.

14:48
And then. Yeah.

14:49
Okay. All right. Okay. Good, good. This is great. Mac.

14:53
Hey, couple things to maybe take back and like opine on. Right. And this =
was. We relate to like, function like Capital Edge and all the stuff we =
were doing. My thought is similar to the hiring tracker. If we can just on =
a weekly basis take your spreadsheet and like post an extract of it on =
Capital Edge and use that whole reporting, I think that's probably easy. =
Like, I don't want to move. It looks like you guys have a process and an =
MLS and your people are actually going into your file and like making =
changes, which is great. So if one person from our team can get like access=
 to the file, ideally on a weekly basis, we can kind of go and pull an =
extract from the file and feed it into Capital Edge. So it shows up in =
functions like reporting status.

15:53
Yes.

15:53
So that like when like finance talks about readiness, like, they also have =
that like systems component that's fed into it.

15:59
Yes, absolutely. And I actually met with Brian on Friday to discuss that. I=
 shared the data model with him. I think that our plan is to get this put =
into Smartsheet and then whatever the regular cadence is, whoever is doing =
the Smartsheet manual uploads to Cap Edge to get them into Cap Edge. We =
built a dashboard. We built a dashboard.

16:29
Yeah.

16:29
Similar to the one that we had mocked up with you guys. And so it's based =
on that underlying data. Let me share this one real quick. So we built that=
 dashboard. Maybe it's not this one, but we built that dashboard. I shared =
it with Brian and he was working on the. Yeah. So Brian is working to =
create something like this in Capital Edge based on the source data and the=
 data model. So. Yeah, yeah. So we will get it loaded into Capital Edge so =
we can do this reporting and then also more.

17:03
Okay.

17:06
I'm specific, specifically talking about like the functions. BRB scorecards=
.

17:11
Yeah.

17:11
There's a swim lane that has like systems on it. Can =
we get a cut of this or like an extract of this spreadsheet like today to =
put into the functions dashboard for next week's workshop?

17:32
Yeah, let me do cut by end of day. Yeah, yeah, there's, there's still like =
we are actively updating this right now and it's kind of an all hands on =
deck thing. So by end of day I'm sure that we could share a cut of it with =
a strong. It's going to change between today and tomorrow. And so as long =
as we denote that.

17:57
Yeah, it's not really, really for tomorrow, it's =
for next Thursday. But we're like across the board freezing data. Like so I=
 guess like if we get it tomorrow, that's also okay.

18:10
Okay.

18:10
But what we're gonna do is just like have everyone's dashboard updated with=
 the correct count of systems which I, I'm hoping like that's not gonna =
change, right? Like utilize like tagged to the function. I'm guessing =
that's not going to change.

18:26
Oh.

18:29
And then like potentially =
like you know, kind of UAT status or something like that. But that's not =
even as relevant to be honest. It's like the number because right now like =
you know, a lot of the functions say like two or like not. You know what I =
mean? So like that's what we're trying to pull into the dashboard.

18:50
Yep, absolutely.

18:52
More. Okay, more important you would, you would.

18:58
See that sheet then from Mac, from you and team as being additive to =
the system cutover tracker. So Instead of having 23 systems that we have =
now, we might have 27 or 32 or something like that.

19:12
Right? Yeah, yeah. We, we got to set up some time with Brian to talk about =
this. There's like a like steady state solution that like, you know, has =
this like smartsheet sync, blah, blah, blah. And then like what I'm trying =
to solve for which is specifically next week's workshop. And so like it =
doesn't even truly have to be in Capital Edge. Like I just want the =
dashboard with the right numbers.

19:37
Gotcha. So even if it's not in =
Capital Edge.

19:40
If.

19:41
Yeah, yeah, we can take down the.

19:43
System tractor and Capital Edge for now. We can put a note saying that like=
 being updated in smartsheets and we'll come into Capital Edge, like, you =
know, in a week or so, but I want to make sure that everyone's dashboard =
has the right number on it. So, like, finance, for example, shouldn't say =
three systems when they're in fact testing more than three systems.

20:05
Right, right, right. Okay, that makes sense. I just wanted to make sure =
that if we were going to be updating in the system cutover tracker, that I =
could put some thought behind that, since, as you know, with the hiring =
file, sometimes there are some things that exist.

20:19
In the source data that don't in.

20:21
The tracker, and so just want to =
make sure to match those up. But it sounds like that won't be an issue.

20:25
Yeah, let's set up some time with Brian on, like, how he can just, =
like, finagle these reports for next week.

20:31
Okay, cool.

20:33
And in the meantime, like I said, we can just take down the system tracker.

20:36
We don't.

20:37
We can't. Kind of put a note there to say, like, =
coming soon or whatever.

20:41
Okay, perfect. I'll plan to set some time =
pre wig tomorrow after the opsep call. Do you think that would be good? I =
just want to avoid making any changes before the OPSEP calls that mess up =
the report.

20:54
For sure.

20:55
For sure.

20:55
Okay, cool. I'll set some time for the three of us then.

20:58
The three of us? You.

20:59
Not including you, Mac, unless you, like, =
desperately want to hear the conversation with Brian on this, but I'm =
guessing you have other things you'd like to do instead.

21:05
Yeah, you can put me as optional. We had a good connect before. I need to =
share this updated data model with him anyway, so might be good to chat. =
But tomorrow is looks terrible, so put me on optional and I'll let you guys=
 know.

21:20
Okay, Sounds good.

21:21
Lovely. Okay, thank you all so much=
.

21:23
Thanks, Nick.

21:24
Thank you.

21:25
Thanks, y' all. Bye.

</ul>
<h3 style=3D"font-weight:500;padding-top:20px;font-size:1.75rem">2. Purpose=
 and Context of the Call</h3><ul>
<li>Main focus: How functional groups =
will report their perception and status of system readiness, specifically =
from a User Acceptance Testing (UAT) perspective.</li>
<li>Discussion centers on validating which functions are testing which =
systems and coordination of test completion for the August 1st, 2025 =

<li>Two key trackers in use: one for =E2=80=9CDay 1=E2=80=9D applications =
and another for the August 1st =E2=80=9CBRV Core=E2=80=9D (~22 systems) and=
 adjacent systems.</li>
<li>These trackers are heat maps capturing statuses=
 (e.g., SIT readiness, UAT start/end dates, assigned resources, environment=
, data availability, go-live dates).</li>
<li>Functional alignment calls =
held with Finance, ISC (Integrated Supply Chain), HR, and others to =
identify core and adjacent systems.<ul>
<li>BRV core currently at 14 =

<li>Each function/workstream is responsible for validating and updating =
their data in the tracker.</li>
<li>Inputs updated manually after being =
sent to workstream leads and service owners (e.g., Harry Tong for Finance).=
</li>
<li>Request from Sukai earlier in the day: develop a table listing =
actual test scripts and tracking detailed results (number, ownership, =
outcome).</li>
<li>ERP team and others are developing standardized =

 Dashboard &amp; Data Integration with Capital Edge</h3><ul>
<li>Proposal to extract the tracker weekly and update the functions&#39; =
dashboards in Capital Edge, ensuring accurate system counts per function =
for the upcoming workshop.</li>
<li>Immediate need: Extract of updated =
tracker by end of day or next day (June 18th) to update dashboards, =
especially highlighting the correct number of systems each function is =
testing.</li>
<li>Long-term plan: Move data consolidation and reporting =
into Smartsheet, synced regularly with Capital Edge for steady-state =
reporting.</li>
<li>Brian is working on integrating the data model and =
dashboard in Capital Edge.</li>
<li>For the upcoming workshop, it=E2=80=99s=
 acceptable if the data isn&#39;t immediately in Capital Edge, so long as =
the correct numbers populate the dashboards.</li>
