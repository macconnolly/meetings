# Temporal Meeting Intelligence - Complete Implementation Context & Decisions

## Project Status & Context
- **Project**: Advanced temporal meeting intelligence system that tracks evolution of decisions/topics over time
- **Current Status**: Foundation models completed (Phase 1), moving to implementation of core features
- **Key Insight**: This is NOT just meeting search - it's temporal evolution tracking with predictive intelligence

## Architectural Decisions Made & Rationale

### Core Architecture (v3 Based)
1. **Dual-store approach**: Weaviate (semantic search) + Neo4j (temporal relationships)
   - **Rationale**: Vector search alone can't track evolution; graph alone can't do semantic matching
   - **Business case**: Enables "How has X evolved?" queries that competitor systems can't handle

2. **Python 3.11+ with type hints throughout**
   - **Rationale**: Type safety improves reliability, modern async support
   - **No deviation**: Standard established early

3. **LLM orchestration throughout** - extraction, understanding, assembly
   - **Rationale**: Human communication too nuanced for rule-based systems
   - **Business case**: Enables understanding of implicit references and context

4. **Temporal-first design** - everything considers time and evolution
   - **Rationale**: This is our competitive advantage vs basic meeting summarizers
   - **Business case**: "Why did we change our approach?" becomes answerable

## What We've Implemented (Phase 1 ✅)

### Enhanced Data Models
- **MemoryChunk** with full temporal fields (temporal_references, version_info, evolution_markers)
- **Weaviate schema** optimized for temporal indexing and semantic search
- **Neo4j models** with 25+ relationship types for temporal tracking
- **Validation**: All models support temporal evolution tracking

### Key Innovations Added
1. **Confidence decay**: All temporal relationships weaken over time unless reinforced
   - **Implementation**: `confidence *= exp(-0.1 * days_elapsed)`
   - **Business case**: Reflects how human memory and relevance actually work

2. **Implicit reference resolution**: Resolve "that approach", "the decision" with confidence scoring
   - **Implementation**: Pattern matching + candidate scoring + temporal weighting
   - **Business case**: Makes system feel intelligent vs literal search

3. **Parallel reality tracking**: Handle multiple interpretations until resolved
   - **Rationale**: Human communication often ambiguous until clarified
   - **Business case**: Graceful handling of conflicting information

## Critical Missing Components (Must Implement)

### Phase 2: Core Extraction Features
1. **Core Question Extraction** (USER REQUIREMENT):
   ```python
   # Extract from friction signals: "still blocked" → "Should we use OAuth or API Keys?"
   # Store as core_question property on Chunk nodes
   # Impact analysis: "Team cannot move forward without this decision"
   ```

2. **Enhanced Implicit Reference Resolution** (USER REQUIREMENT):
   ```python
   # Patterns: "the original X", "that X we discussed", "our X approach"
   # Apply confidence decay: confidence *= exp(-0.1 * time_distance)
   # Multi-hop resolution for complex references
   ```

3. **Date calculation implementation** (USER REQUIREMENT):
   ```python
   # "last week" → specific date range calculation
   # "next Friday" → actual date computation
   # Store calculated dates for temporal queries
   ```

### Phase 3: Complete v3 Implementation
1. **DualStorageManager** (CRITICAL - v3 core):
   - Coordinate Weaviate + Neo4j storage
   - Maintain data consistency across both stores
   - Handle temporal relationship creation

2. **Query Orchestration Engine** (CRITICAL - v3 core):
   - Understand temporal query intent
   - Coordinate dual retrieval (semantic + graph)
   - Iterative context refinement
   - Temporal-aware response assembly

3. **Expertise Modeling** (USER REQUIREMENT):
   ```python
   # Nightly batch: analyze speaking patterns by meeting category
   # Create (Person)-[:EXPERT_IN {confidence, category}]->(Topic)
   # Track expertise evolution over time
   # Model participant expertise to weight future contributions
   ```

### Phase 4: Predictive Features
1. **Predictive Context Assembly** (USER REQUIREMENT + Appendix A):
   - Predict follow-up questions based on patterns
   - Generate meeting preparation briefs
   - Identify unresolved threads needing attention
   - Pre-fetch likely needed context

## Implementation Priorities (From User Feedback)

### CRITICAL (Do First):
1. **Complete v3 DualStorageManager** - Core storage operations
2. **Core Question Extraction** - Friction signals → specific questions
3. **Query Orchestration Engine** - The "brain" coordinating everything
4. **Implicit Reference Resolution** - "that approach" with confidence decay
5. **Basic API endpoints** - User-facing functionality

### HIGH PRIORITY (Second Wave):
6. **Expertise Modeling** - Nightly Neo4j updates
7. **Predictive Context Assembly** - Anticipate follow-up questions
8. **Complete v3 extraction pipeline** - Technical content, version chains
9. **Response generation** - Temporal-aware formatting
10. **Date calculation** - Parse temporal references to dates

## Technical Implementation Details

### LLM Integration Strategy
- **Primary**: OpenAI GPT-4 for complex extraction/assembly
- **Secondary**: GPT-3.5 for simple tasks (cost optimization)
- **Fallback**: Anthropic Claude for reliability
- **Cost target**: <$0.10 per query

### Database Schema
- **Weaviate**: 2 classes (MemoryChunk, Meeting) with temporal indexing
- **Neo4j**: 9 node types, 25+ relationship types with temporal properties
- **Constraints**: All unique IDs, performance indexes created

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Graceful degradation**: Partial results better than failures
- **LLM failures**: Fallback to simpler processing
- **Database failures**: Read-only mode vs full failure
- **Confidence scoring**: All results include uncertainty levels

## Business Value Delivered
1. **Temporal intelligence**: "How has our architecture evolved?" 
2. **Implicit understanding**: "Update the deadline" → knows which deadline based on context
3. **Predictive preparation**: "You'll likely be asked about X, here's what you need"
4. **Decision archaeology**: "Why did we change approaches?" with full rationale

## Development Lessons Learned
1. **Efficiency critical**: User expects detailed implementation plans, not high-level concepts
2. **v3 example is authoritative**: Only deviate with strong business rationale
3. **Temporal awareness is key differentiator**: Every feature must consider time/evolution
4. **Confidence decay essential**: Reflects reality of how information relevance changes

## Next Session Priorities
1. Implement DualStorageManager with both Weaviate and Neo4j operations
2. Build Core Question Extraction with friction signal detection
3. Create Query Orchestration Engine for temporal query processing
4. Add Implicit Reference Resolution with confidence decay
5. Implement basic API endpoints for user interaction

## File Organization
- `/meeting-intelligence/src/models/` - Data models ✅ completed
- `/meeting-intelligence/src/ingestion/` - Extraction pipeline (partial)
- `/meeting-intelligence/src/storage/` - Database clients (needs DualStorageManager)
- `/meeting-intelligence/src/query/` - Query processing (needs orchestrator)
- `/meeting-intelligence/src/api/` - FastAPI endpoints (needs implementation)

## Context Preservation Notes
- User frustrated with efficiency issues and wants detailed implementation
- v3_Example_Implementation.md contains authoritative architecture
- All deviations must have documented business rationale
- Focus on temporal intelligence as key differentiator
- System must handle "soft" human communication, not just literal search
