# Agent Instructions

Every change to this repository must explicitly reference the tasks in `CLAUDE_TASK_TRACKER.md`.

- **Commit messages** should mention the relevant tracker tasks using the format `[Task X]` where `X` is the task number.
- **Pull request summaries** must include a section called "Task Tracker Reference" listing the task numbers or titles covered by the changes.
- Do not modify `CLAUDE_TASK_TRACKER.md` automatically unless explicitly instructed.

These guidelines ensure traceability between code changes and the project plan.
