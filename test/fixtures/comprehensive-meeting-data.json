Current tracker shows 347 applications, but detailed validation reveals 422 actual applications - a 75-application gap.\n\nImmediate Actions:\n• ISC team (Michael Chen) leading comprehensive validation sprint - completion by June 18\n• Technical review of data synchronization processes initiated\n• Updated inventory will inform final UAT planning and resource allocation\n\nThis remains on critical path for our June 25 workshop. Please ensure all functional area representatives are available to support validation efforts.\n\nNext update: June 18 with complete validated inventory.\n\nBest regards,\n[Name]"
