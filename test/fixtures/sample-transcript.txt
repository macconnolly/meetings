Subject: Project Alpha Status Update Meeting - June 17, 2025
Date: June 17, 2025 at 2:00 PM EST
Participants: Alice Johnson (Project Lead), Bob Smith (Technical Lead), Carol Davis (Resource Manager), David Lee (Integration Specialist)

--- MEETING TRANSCRIPT ---

Alice Johnson: Good afternoon everyone. Let's start our Project Alpha status update. We have several critical items to discuss today regarding our Q3 deliverables.

Bob Smith: Thanks Alice. I want to start with the technical update. We've made significant progress on the core API integration, but we're facing some challenges with the legacy system compatibility.

Carol Davis: Before we dive into technical details, I should mention that we have some resource constraints coming up. Two of our senior developers will be transitioning to Project Beta next month.

Alice Johnson: That's concerning timing, Carol. Let's address that after we understand the technical challenges. Bob, can you elaborate on the legacy system issues?

Bob Smith: Certainly. The main issue is that the legacy CRM system uses an outdated authentication protocol that doesn't support our new OAuth 2.0 implementation. We have three options: modify our new system to support both protocols, create a middleware adapter, or upgrade the legacy system.

David Lee: I've been working on the integration layer, and I think the middleware adapter approach would be our best bet. It would take approximately 3-4 weeks to implement and test thoroughly.

Alice Johnson: What are the risks with that approach, David?

David Lee: The main risks are additional complexity in our architecture and potential performance overhead. However, it maintains backward compatibility and doesn't require changes to the legacy system.

Carol Davis: From a resource perspective, we can allocate one additional developer to David's team for the middleware work. However, we need to make this decision quickly due to the upcoming team transitions.

Alice Johnson: Excellent. Let's make that decision now. I propose we proceed with the middleware adapter approach. David, can you lead that effort with the additional developer Carol mentioned?

David Lee: Absolutely. I'll need Bob's team to provide API specifications and testing protocols.

Bob Smith: That works for me. We can have those ready by end of week.

Alice Johnson: Great. Now, regarding the Q3 timeline, are we still on track for our September 15th deliverable?

Bob Smith: With the middleware approach, we might have a 2-week delay. I recommend adjusting our target to September 30th to account for integration testing.

Carol Davis: That timeline change affects our Q4 planning. I'll need to coordinate with the Project Beta team to adjust their start date.

Alice Johnson: Understood. Let's make these adjustments. Moving to our next agenda item - the client demo preparation.

David Lee: The demo environment is ready, but we should wait until the middleware integration is complete before scheduling with the client.

Alice Johnson: Agreed. Let's plan for a client demo in early October, pending successful completion of our integration work.

Bob Smith: I'll prepare a technical demonstration script and coordinate with marketing for the client presentation materials.

Carol Davis: I'll handle the logistics and client communication for scheduling.

Alice Johnson: Perfect. Before we wrap up, any other concerns or items that need immediate attention?

David Lee: Just one item - we should consider having a contingency plan if the middleware approach encounters unexpected complications.

Bob Smith: Good point. The fallback would be the OAuth protocol modification option, which would add another 2-3 weeks to our timeline.

Alice Johnson: Noted. Let's document both approaches in our project plan. Carol, can you update our risk register with these items?

Carol Davis: Absolutely. I'll have the updated documentation ready for review by tomorrow morning.

Alice Johnson: Excellent work everyone. Let me summarize our action items and decisions before we close.

--- ACTION ITEMS ---
1. David Lee to lead middleware adapter implementation with additional developer resource (Due: 3-4 weeks)

6. Carol Davis to handle client demo logistics and scheduling (Due: October)

--- DECISIONS MADE ---
1. Proceed with middleware adapter approach for legacy system integration
2. Adjust Q3 deliverable target from September 15th to September 30th
3. Allocate additional developer resource to integration team
4. Schedule client demo for early October pending integration completion
5. Maintain OAuth 2.0 protocol modification as backup plan
