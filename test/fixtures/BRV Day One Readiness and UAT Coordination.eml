BRV Day One Readiness and UAT Coordination

- **UAT Prep Materials & =
Access**
    - All User Acceptance Testing (UAT) preparation materials have=
 been uploaded.
    - Materials are located in the Honeywell folder, =
specifically in Athens, under =E2=80=9C10 CSS=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9C17 BRV =
81.=E2=80=9D
    - A link will be sent to relevant team members (e.g., =
Arpit) for access.
    - File skeletons are being created for organizing =
content.

- **Roadmap and Milestones**
    - A notes document outlining the=
 roadmap for UAT readiness ("go/no-go" status) will be shared.
    - This contains granular details; team members should extract key =
milestones from now until day one.
    - Immediate focus is on line items =
highlighted in yellow within the tracking document=E2=80=94these require =
follow-up and status updates.

- **Action Items & Immediate Next Steps**
    - Team member is tasked to, within 1.5 to 2 hours, follow up on all =
yellow-highlighted items in the first column of the tracking sheet.
    - Contacts for follow-up include Steve Delat, Yunji Duan, Paul Z., and =
others (with check-in on whether these people are known).
    - Use example questions or templates to standardize outreach, =
requesting validation of the team's current understanding and specifics for=
 =E2=80=9Csoft spin=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cday one=E2=80=9D scenarios.

- **BRV Spin Operating Model & Day One Readiness**
    - The =E2=80=9CBRV =
spin operating model=E2=80=9D refers to the operational readiness of key =
IT-for-IT processes for day one (noted as August 1st).
    - Each business function (Finance, HR, Supply Chain, IT, Compliance, =
etc.) has standard processes; at day one, Solstice is expected to manage or=
 outsource these as required.
    - Some functions may continue existing =
(Honeywell) processes; changes are only required where necessary to support=
 BRV.
    - Two approaches for process transition:
        - **In-house =
Ownership:** Solstice takes control, updates systems, and hires staff as =
needed.
        - **Outsourcing:** If not feasible otherwise due to =
staffing or technical constraints, process is outsourced via =
DSA/DSA-to-remain core.
    - Examples:
        - **HR:** Some processes =
change (e.g., global payroll outsourced to ADP); US/Canada payroll remains =
in current system; employee transfers executed at day one.
        - **Supply Chain:** Not started pending additional hires.
        - **Compliance/Data Center:** No significant process change; status=
 mainly confirms readiness.
        - **CCEX (Commercial/Outreach =
Platforms):** No process change anticipated for BRV, but staffing up for =
commercial processes should be confirmed.
    - The =
=E2=80=9Cstatus=E2=80=9D field in the document refers more to the process =
scope and impact for BRV, not just readiness.

- **Clarifications =
Required**
    - Confirm no process changes for specific entities (e.g., =
BRV CCEX, day one CCEX) and validate staffing status and necessity.
    - For functions like DCN: clarify oversight and hiring for managed =
services and TSA (Transition Service Agreement) operations.
    - For HR: note any delays (e.g., Learning Management and Advanced =
Compensation not ready by day one, but hiring on track).

- **Summary Guidance**
    - The executive summary should focus on only =
those changes required for BRV; these changes should be itemized (A, B, C, =
D, etc.).
    - Majority of processes will undergo no significant change =
and are continuing through Honeywell.
    - Risks, critical calls, and =
exceptions (such as delayed systems/services or dependencies) must be =
flagged.

- **Meeting and Coordination**
    - Immediate internal meeting =
in 10 minutes referenced; coordination on rapid follow-ups is emphasized.
    - Team members are encouraged to follow up directly (chat, meeting, or =
ping), using provided examples/templates for inquiries.

**Key Dates and Figures Mentioned:**
- **Day One / Go-Live:** August 1st
- **Time Allocated for Follow-ups:** 1.5=E2=80=932 hours immediately after =
the meeting
- **Specific Process Owners, Functions, or Areas Mentioned:**
    - Steve Delat, Yunji Duan, Paul Z.
    - Key processes: HR, Supply =
Chain, Compliance, DCN, CCEX, Salesforce/Commercial platforms

**Immediate Priorities:**
- Validate status and scope for =
yellow-highlighted items relating to BRV day one readiness.
- Secure confirmations on process changes, required staffing, and risk =
areas from identified contacts.
- Clarify and correct the =
disposition/status in process documentation where necessary.

Transcript:
0:00
All of the UAT prep material, it's in.

0:05
Can you send us the link =
or just tell me I can open it live if you know where it is.

0:13
I had it open for this workshop. Or just in general.

0:19
I'm assuming you're working on a Honeywell folder, right? Somewhere.

0:24
Yeah, it's in Athens. Essentially 10 CSS and then I think it's 17. Let me =
see.

0:35
It's.

0:35
Yeah, 17 BRV 81.

0:38
Okay, good. I'm gonna send =
this link to Arpit. I'm sending this to you so that you can. If you don't =
have it already, let's just go it. I'm stuck. All right, I'll send you the =
link. You can put the file or skeleton.

1:34
That will be here. I'm gonna =
send you guys both. I'm just gonna chat you my notes on the roadmap to go. =
No go for UAT readiness. And this is probably a level more granular than =
you guys need. But you can pull out the key milestones from this between =
now and day one.

2:01
Okay? All right, that's fine. We'll create the =
skeleton. Now what I need your help on for the next two hours or one and a =
half hours or so. I sent you the link. Whatever is green is already updated=
 this.

2:52
Yeah.

2:55
So I'm gonna highlight the ones that I need a =
support on. You know these people, I'm assuming you would have reached out =
to them for other stuff or do you not know who they are?

3:13
Steve Delat. I have met. Yunji. I don't think I've met. I've probably met =
in a call, but not directly. Steve. I have Steve again. And then Paul Z. I =
haven't met. Okay, I should text for cash back.

3:45
You have an in person meeting in 10 minutes, right? Yes.

3:50
So what do you need on this?

3:52
Whatever is yellow highlighted on the =
first column, I want you to follow up on right now. Others will take care =
of. I will take care of the others.

4:09
Is there context for like. So the=
 way Rakesh couldn't explain to me the BRV spin operating model. Like what =
is.

4:21
What.

4:21
What do you mean by BRB spin operating model.

4:25
Okay, so any organization would have a set of processes. Each function has =
their own set of processes. Right. Finance has. HR has hired to retire. =
Finance has whatever like order to close. Right. There are business process=
 that each function has. Yeah, it has a bunch of it for it processes.

4:49
Okay.

4:49
Right. Yeah. Processes around compliance. Dcn we've not gone =
into each process but like these are the sub function areas within it that =
has it for it processes that will need staffing, someone to do the =
execution, some management. Right? Yeah. Now as a day one entity, Solstice =
is expected to either take control of these IT for IT processes and have =
like systems updated and people hired to take over these processes.

5:25
Yeah.

5:26
Or in some cases where the process is like if there's not =
enough staffing or because there's a huge system dependency and they can't =
take over the process, they're going to outsource the process through a DSA=
 to remain core. DCN is a good example. And any networking services that =
are for TSA applications will continue to be serviced through the network =
tsa. And so certain processes will be outsourced. But majority of the it4it=
 for anything that's built back ready for day one will then go through the =
standard channels. They don't need DCN to do the server.

6:07
And so what's the framing of this column? So then in that context, BRV spin=
 operating model is the framing here preparedness for day one or for =
whatever August 1st or day one for the key IT for IT processes in their =
area. So like supply chain, all processes including demand management =
supply. Are we. So is the framing what is covered? Are we asking them to =
tell us what is covered or the status of the status towards readiness?

6:49
It's the status towards.

6:51
It's because this supply chain one it =
says all processes, including there's the supply.

6:59
Chain one go forward to.

7:04
It's on five. So all processes, including =
demand management, supply, inventory, production, planning, siop, whatever =
direct procurement, to name a few, have not started pending incremental =
hires.

7:18
Yeah.

7:19
Is that a good example of what you need? So it's a=
 status update.

7:25
This is not what we need. What would be good is. Let =
me give you an example.

7:30
Yeah. I'm just trying to understand the =
framing. Are we looking for status or are we looking for scope?

7:35
It's more scope or no process change for the majority at BRB, which is 8:1 =
majority of the processes are going to be continued through the Honeywell =
process. So there's not going to be a process change per se, but there =
would be some areas that would get impacted to enable brv. Yeah. Right. So =
if you look at this example, HR is a good one where HR is saying that these=
 are the process changes that will happen or certain impactful changes that=
 we'll have to take care of to enable BRB Global payroll to be outsourced =
to ADP by brb. Yeah. On track for it. US Canada payroll will be configured =
in the existing payroll system. Right. And then employee Transfers will =
need to be executed by 8.1 or on 8.1 using the current system. So like it's=
 really highlight of what needs to be touched to enable brv. You'll see =
majority of the other ones are NA and in some cases we've given some =
justification like compliance. Nothing's changing Data center. We're just =
saying primary and secondary colos.

8:45
Are stood up but ccex there's =
going to be.

8:50
So nothing for Dave or nothing for brb.

8:53
Again nothing for BRV for ccex. Yeah. Yeah I guess that's.

8:59
It's your Salesforce and commercial like outreach platforms. Right. =
Salesforce and what else Marketo and the Adobe suite for.

9:10
But SFDC is in our BRV list.

9:16
It's an adjacent so there's some testing=
 that needs to happen to sfdc.

9:21
Yeah. ISC has to test sftc. So ISC has=
 a dependency on SFDC and as a part of one of the ISC processes they have =
to test SFDC for their process.

9:42
BRB readiness for their process. But =
SFDC is not changing. Right. They're going to use Honeywell SFDC and just =
validate if the integration is working.

9:56
No, they're not. They're =
doing a. Oh, I guess it is Live without. Yeah so it's. It's Live without =
but there's still UAT testing Live without for day one. No, for. Yeah it =
says the disposition is no SFDC CRM.

10:18
That is not a Live without that=
 is a tsa.

10:21
It says Live without in the disposition.

10:23
Is it final day one disposition you're referring to?

10:26
I haven't Master inventory.

10:29
Like what is it? Where are you seeing?

10:32
I don't know the whole whoever RPM on the Honeywell side populated =
this so I guess we should. I should probably go look up. She probably used =
the wrong column from the master inventory to look up this column.

10:49
Anyway, this page is not more like we don't have to go too detailed into =
system.

10:55
Sure.

10:55
The intent of this is a high level BRV =
readiness process impact view.

11:01
Yeah.

11:02
The short story in the =
executive summary is going to be only like specific changes need to happen =
to enable BRV and those changes are A, B, C and D. Yes. Right. And this is =
the double click on it saying nothing is changing. Nothing is changing. =
Slight updates.

11:19
So to Yunji I will go and say need to confirm that =
four BRV ccex no process changes for brb.

11:30
Yes. And then for on day =
one are we going to do. Are we going to have any process changes? My =
understanding is all processes will also be TSA for CCEX but is there =
anything that she needs to staff up to take over any of the commercial =
processes for day one? If yes, tell us what those are.

11:50
Anything she needs to staff up to take over the processes.

11:53
Yeah. So if you look at DCN as an example here, all conveyed systems will =
be managed by end to end solstice, incremental hires, managed services. =
Incremental hires will also support oversight of TSH systems. That is it. =
Nothing major like who will take care of whatever is built back? If there's=
 anything built back. Yeah. And then for anything else, are they good on =
hiring and then are there any risks? Some folks have put in some risks or =
considerations like again, HR is a good example. HR is basically put =
Learning management and advanced compensation will go. Go live a little bit=
 later. But no incremental hiring is required but won't be ready by day one=
. So it's kind of like a call out that they've made while everything is =
going to be ready. So again, HR basically says HCM to be completely =
supported by solstice hiring on track. Learning management system will be =
on short term tsa. That's it. That is their sort of process summary. Yeah. =
So just these three pages. Spend an hour. Just ping these folks. I hope you=
 have their names so you're able to figure those out. Steve Delat, Yunji =
Duan.

13:26
Yeah, I have their names.

13:27
You have all of them? Mahim? =
Yeah, yeah, right. Just sit with them. Have them fill it up. Sit with them =
or ping them saying. Can you fill this up real quick?

13:37
Yeah, I'm gonna ping them. Probably two cells with a header with like =
example questions like this is our understanding. Can you please validate =
and then please answer these questions either for soft spin or day one, =
soft spin or.

13:55
Yeah, all right, thank you. Just. I know it's a little=
 bit busy. It's not full, you know.

<li>This contains granular details; team members should extract key =

<ul>
<li>Team member is tasked to, within 1.5 to 2 =
hours, follow up on all yellow-highlighted items in the first column of the=
 tracking sheet.</li>
<li>Contacts for follow-up include Steve Delat, Yunji=
 Duan, Paul Z., and others (with check-in on whether these people are =
known).</li>
<li>Use example questions or templates to standardize outreach=
, requesting validation of the team&#39;s current understanding and =

scenarios.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">BRV =
Spin Operating Model &amp; Day One Readiness</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The =E2=80=9CBRV spin operating model=E2=80=9D refers to the =
operational readiness of key IT-for-IT processes for day one (noted as =
August 1st).</li>
<li>Each business function (Finance, HR, Supply Chain, IT=
, Compliance, etc.) has standard processes; at day one, Solstice is =
expected to manage or outsource these as required.</li>
<li>Some functions may continue existing (Honeywell) processes; changes are=
 only required where necessary to support BRV.</li>
<li>Two approaches for process transition:<ul>
<li><strong =
style=3D"font-weight:bold">In-house Ownership:</strong> Solstice takes =
control, updates systems, and hires staff as needed.</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Outsourcing:</strong> If not =
feasible otherwise due to staffing or technical constraints, process is =
outsourced via DSA/DSA-to-remain core.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Examples:<ul>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">HR:</strong> Some processes change =
(e.g., global payroll outsourced to ADP); US/Canada payroll remains in =
current system; employee transfers executed at day one.</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Supply Chain:</strong> Not started =
pending additional hires.</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Compl=
iance/Data Center:</strong> No significant process change; status mainly =
confirms readiness.</li>
<li><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">CCEX =
(Commercial/Outreach Platforms):</strong> No process change anticipated for=
 BRV, but staffing up for commercial processes should be confirmed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The =E2=80=9Cstatus=E2=80=9D field in the document refers =
more to the process scope and impact for BRV, not just readiness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Clarifications =
Required</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Confirm no process changes for specific =
entities (e.g., BRV CCEX, day one CCEX) and validate staffing status and =
necessity.</li>
<li>For functions like DCN: clarify oversight and hiring =
for managed services and TSA (Transition Service Agreement) operations.=
</li>
<li>For HR: note any delays (e.g., Learning Management and Advanced =
Compensation not ready by day one, but hiring on track).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Summary Guidance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The executive summary should focus on only those changes required =
for BRV; these changes should be itemized (A, B, C, D, etc.).</li>
<li>Majority of processes will undergo no significant change and are =
continuing through Honeywell.</li>
<li>Risks, critical calls, and =
exceptions (such as delayed systems/services or dependencies) must be =
flagged.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong style=3D"font-weight:bold">Meeting=
 and Coordination</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Immediate internal meeting in 10 =
minutes referenced; coordination on rapid follow-ups is emphasized.</li>
<li>Team members are encouraged to follow up directly (chat, meeting, or =
ping), using provided examples/templates for inquiries.</li>
</ul>
</li>

is going to be ready. So again, HR basically says HCM to be completely =
supported by solstice hiring on track. Learning management system will be =

Yeah. So just these three pages. Spend an hour. Just ping these folks. I =
hope you have their names so you&#x27;re able to figure those out. Steve =
