## Critical Integration Points

### Data Flow Integration

2. **Query** â†’ **Intent Understanding** â†’ **Dual Retrieval** â†’ **Context Assembly** â†’ **Predictive Enhancement** â†’ **Response**

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit tests**: Each class/function tested independently
2. **Integration tests**: Full pipeline testing with real data
3. **Performance tests**: Load testing with concurrent operations
4. **Validation tests**: Accuracy testing with ground truth

### Dependencies & Order
1. Must complete DualStorageManager before query processing
2. Core question extraction can be developed in parallel
3. Predictive features depend on having historical data
4. API layer depends on all core components

This detailed plan provides function-level implementation guidance while maintaining the architectural integrity of the v3 specification.
